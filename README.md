# About

The application is conceived as a platform for escape rooms out in the open. Instead of paying for private spaces to maintain as escape rooms, it allows anyone who can think of a good puzzle to register as a creator and create an "escape room" in the city, leaving clues throughout city locations such that the app guides the players using camera, augmented reality (AR), maps etc. to uncover hidden clues on each location which gives hint to the next clue or location. The players can register and pay for a puzzle using in-game tokens which can be bought with real money. The puzzle starts at a designated time, allowing several players playing the same
puzzle to gather at the starting location in the city, and solving it together, make new friends as well as explore the city in the question either as residents or tourists.
